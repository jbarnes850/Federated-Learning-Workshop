# NEAR AI: Federated Learning For Social Impact Workshop

A Quick Start Guide to Building Privacy-Preserving AI Networks for Social Impact using Nillion's AIVM framework.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/jbarnes850/Federated-Learning-Workshop
cd Federated-Learning-Workshop
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify setup
python examples/1_basic_setup/test_setup.py
```

## Workshop Exercises

1. [Basic Setup](./exercises/1_setup_exercise.md) - Environment and AIVM setup
2. [Data Privacy](./exercises/2_privacy_exercise.md) - Encrypt sensitive data
3. [Model Development](./exercises/3_model_exercise.md) - Deploy BERT model
4. [Network Implementation](./exercises/4_network_exercise.md) - Build secure network

## The Problem: Data Silos in Food Security

Food banks collect valuable data about:

- Community needs and vulnerabilities
- Demand patterns and seasonality
- Resource allocation effectiveness
- Supply chain optimization opportunities

However, this data remains siloed because:

- Privacy concerns about vulnerable populations
- Data protection regulations
- Trust issues between organizations
- Technical barriers to secure sharing

This leads to:

- Inefficient resource allocation
- Missed collaboration opportunities
- Limited insights into broader patterns
- Reduced ability to predict and respond to needs

## The Solution: Federated Learning

Federated Learning enables organizations to collaborate without sharing sensitive data. Here's how it works:

### 1. Local Data Stays Local

- Each food bank keeps their sensitive data on their own servers
- No raw data ever leaves their system
- Full control over their community's information

### 2. Distributed Learning

Instead of sharing data, each node:

- Trains the AI model on their local data
- Learns patterns specific to their community
- Maintains privacy of individual records

### 3. Secure Model Updates

The network only shares:

- Model weight updates (not data)
- Aggregated insights
- Performance metrics

### 4. Collective Intelligence

This creates a system where:

- All participants benefit from collective learning
- Privacy is preserved by design
- Trust is maintained through transparency
- Impact is amplified through collaboration
