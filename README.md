A Quick Start Guide to Building Privacy-Preserving AI Networks for Social Impact using Nillion's AIVM framework.

## Workshop Setup

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jbarnes850/Federated-Learning-Workshop
cd Federated-Learning-Workshop

# Run installation script
chmod +x Examples/1_Basic_Setup/install.sh
./Examples/1_Basic_Setup/install.sh
```

### 2. Start AIVM Devnet

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
# Start the devnet (keep this terminal open)
aivm-devnet
```

### 3. Verify Installation

In your original terminal:

```bash
# Verify setup
python Examples/1_Basic_Setup/test_setup.py
```

   - Environment validation
   - AIVM connectivity check
   - Model support verification

2. [Data Privacy](./Exercises/2_privacy_exercise.md)
   - Generate test data
   - Implement encryption
   - Verify privacy preservation

3. [Model Development](./Exercises/3_model_exercise.md)
   - Deploy BERT model
   - Test predictions
   - Validate security

4. [Network Implementation](./Exercises/4_network_exercise.md)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

### Check Devnet Status

```bash
# In a new terminal
chmod +x Examples/utils/manage_devnet.sh
./Examples/utils/manage_devnet.sh status
```

### Restart Devnet if Needed

```bash
# Kill existing devnet
pkill -f "aivm-devnet"

# Start fresh devnet
aivm-devnet
```

### Verify Environment

```bash
# Check installation
python Examples/1_Basic_Setup/test_setup.py
```

## Bridging Privacy and Social Impact: A Food Security Case Study

In today's world, food banks serve as critical lifelines for vulnerable populations, collecting invaluable data that could change how we address food insecurity. This data encompasses detailed insights into community needs, seasonal demand patterns, resource distribution effectiveness, and supply chain dynamics. However, a fundamental challenge persists: while sharing this information could dramatically improve service delivery and resource allocation, privacy concerns and regulatory requirements create necessary barriers to collaboration.

The consequences of these data silos are far-reaching. Food banks operate with limited visibility into broader regional patterns, leading to suboptimal resource distribution and missed opportunities for collaborative impact. Without a comprehensive view of community needs, organizations struggle to proactively respond to emerging challenges or implement data-driven improvements to their services.

## Federated Learning: Preserving Privacy While Maximizing Impact

This is where Federated Learning and decentralized AI come together to solve real-world problems. By enabling secure, privacy-preserving collaboration, this approach allows food banks to leverage the power of collective data insights while maintaining strict protection of sensitive information. Here's how this revolutionary framework operates:

### The Privacy-First Architecture

At its core, Federated Learning maintains data sovereignty - each food bank retains complete control over their sensitive information, which never leaves their secure systems. Instead of centralizing data, the framework distributes the learning process across the network. Each organization's system independently analyzes local data patterns, from seasonal demand fluctuations to community-specific needs, while ensuring individual records remain strictly confidential.

### Secure Collaboration Mechanics

The magic happens through secure model updates. Rather than sharing raw data, organizations exchange only encrypted model improvements and aggregated insights. This approach ensures that while the network becomes collectively smarter, individual privacy remains inviolate. Performance metrics help track the system's effectiveness while maintaining complete data protection.

### Amplifying Social Impact

The result is a powerful ecosystem where:

- Organizations leverage collective intelligence to improve service delivery
- Privacy protection builds trust with vulnerable communities
- Collaboration scales impact without compromising security
- Data-driven insights enhance resource allocation and program effectiveness

This privacy-preserving framework transforms how food security organizations can work together, enabling them to better serve their communities while maintaining the highest standards of data protection and trust.
