# Federated Learning Workshop Outline

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- AIVM devnet installed
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

## Workshop Flow

### 1. Basic Setup and Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies and setup environment
./Examples/1_Basic_Setup/install.sh

# Start AIVM devnet (in separate terminal)
# Option 1: Run directly
aivm-devnet

# Option 2: Use helper script 
./Examples/utils/manage_devnet.sh start

# Verify setup
python Examples/1_Basic_Setup/test_setup.py
```

- Introduction to AIVM
- Environment setup verification
- Basic connectivity testing

### 2. Data Privacy Implementation

```bash
# Generate synthetic data
python Examples/2_Data_Privacy/food_bank_data.py

# Test encryption capabilities
python Examples/2_Data_Privacy/encrypt_data.py

# Run privacy demonstration
python Examples/2_Data_Privacy/privacy_demo.py
```

- Synthetic data generation
- Data encryption techniques
- Privacy preservation demonstration
- Secure data handling

### 3. Model Development

```bash
# Setup base model
python Examples/3_Model_Development/bert_food_security.py

# Train model with enhanced data
python Examples/3_Model_Development/train_model.py

# Test model capabilities
python Examples/3_Model_Development/test_model.py
```

- BertTiny model setup
- Training process
- Model testing and validation
- Performance evaluation

### 4. Full Implementation

```bash
# Configure network
python Examples/4_Full_Implementation/config.py

# Initialize network
python Examples/4_Full_Implementation/food_security_network.py

# Run complete demonstration
python Examples/4_Full_Implementation/demo.py
```

- Network configuration
- Full system integration
- End-to-end demonstration
- Real-world application scenarios
