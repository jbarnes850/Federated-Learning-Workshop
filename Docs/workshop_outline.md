## Technical Components

### 1. Data Privacy Layer

```python
class FoodBankPrivacy:
    """Core privacy preservation for food bank data"""
    def encrypt_demand_data(self, data):
        return aic.BertTinyCryptensor(data)
        
    def secure_compute(self, encrypted_data):
        return aic.get_prediction(encrypted_data)
```

### 2. Model Architecture

```python
class FoodSecurityModel:
    """Custom BertTiny for food security"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_name = "FoodSecurityBERT"
        
    def deploy(self):
        upload_bert_tiny_model(
            self.model_path,
            self.model_name
        )
```

### 3. Network Implementation

```python
class FoodSecurityNetwork:
    """Collaborative food security network"""
    async def predict_demand(self, local_data):
        encrypted = self.encrypt_data(local_data)
        return await self.secure_predict(encrypted)
```
